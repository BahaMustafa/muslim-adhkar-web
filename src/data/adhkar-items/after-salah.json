Following the practice of the Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ), these supplications include Tasbih, Tahmid, and Takbir, as well as specific verses like Ayatul Kursi. Reciting these immediately after the Taslim provides a spiritual bridge between the prayer and daily life. Our database follows the authentic narrations found in Sahih Muslim and Sunan an-Nasa'i.",
